#cleanse
Coming together as a team, we centered on the importance of simplicity and minimalism in a culture where mobile devices have become integrated into our lives. We pinpointed something close to us all —photos, which are often taken in the moment and then forgotten…clogging up your device’s storage. Disorganized photo libraries—meet cleanse.

#Purpose

A simple and intuitive iOS app to declutter your photo library. Utilize our "size cleanse" option to quickly sort your photos by size and delete those that are taking the most space. If you are looking to declutter, "magic cleanse" uses a special algorithm to suggest photos we feel would be best to delete, such as wasteful burst photos or forgotten screenshots. Cleanse also offers a full detox feature which will clear your entire camera roll for you, an option not currently offered by the iphone.
